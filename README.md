This countplot shows that Fruits and Vegetables are the Item Type that is sold in the highest quantity.

## Model

The recommended model for this business problem is the Random Forest model with tuning.

This was the most appropriate model due to it having the highest R^2 score, 0.603, and the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 728.570.

The R^2 score of 0.603 indicates that this model can account for 60.3% of outcome variation. The MAE of 728.570 indicates that the predictions wmade by the model were erroneous by an average of about 729 items.
